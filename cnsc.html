    { q: "What is the role of zinc in the body, and what are signs of its deficiency?", a: "Zinc is crucial for immune function, wound healing, taste, smell, and growth. Deficiency signs include poor wound healing, hair loss (alopecia), dermatitis, impaired taste (dysgeusia), and impaired immune function." },
    { q: "How does hyperglycemia affect fluid balance in critically ill patients?", a: "It can lead to osmotic diuresis, causing fluid and electrolyte losses (polyuria, polydipsia), and potentially dehydration." },
    { q: "What is the typical starting rate for initiation of enteral nutrition in a stable adult?", a: "Often 10-40 mL/hour, advanced by 10-25 mL/hour every 4-8 hours as tolerated to goal rate." },
    { q: "Name a common complication of long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN) on liver function.", a: "Parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD) or cholestasis. Can progress to steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis." },
    { q: "What is the significance of the Respiratory Quotient (RQ) in indirect calorimetry?", a: "RQ indicates the type of fuel being metabolized (carbohydrates ~1.0, fat ~0.7, protein ~0.8). An RQ >1.0 can indicate overfeeding or lipogenesis." },
    { q: "What is the difference between isotonic and hypertonic enteral formulas?", a: "Isotonic formulas have an osmolality similar to body fluids (~300 mOsm/kg H2O), while hypertonic formulas have a higher osmolality (>300 mOsm/kg H2O)." },
    { q: "Which fat-soluble vitamin is involved in blood clotting?", a: "Vitamin K." },
    { q: "What is acrodermatitis enteropathica and which mineral deficiency causes it?", a: "A genetic disorder or acquired condition characterized by dermatitis, diarrhea, and alopecia, caused by zinc deficiency." },
    { q: "How is indirect calorimetry used to determine energy expenditure?", a: "It measures oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) to calculate resting energy expenditure (REE) and respiratory quotient (RQ)." },
    { q: "What is steatorrhea and what does it indicate?", a: "The presence of excess fat in feces. It indicates malabsorption of fat in the small intestine, often due to pancreatic insufficiency, bile acid deficiency, or mucosal damage." },
    { q: "List three conditions that increase protein requirements.", a: "Burns, severe trauma, sepsis, major surgery, large wounds, significant catabolic states." },
    { q: "What is the appropriate management for a patient with refeeding syndrome experiencing hypophosphatemia?", a: "Slow down or temporarily hold nutrition, correct phosphate with IV supplementation, monitor other electrolytes (K, Mg), and carefully re-initiate feeding at a reduced rate." },
    { q: "Why is vitamin B12 (cobalamin) important, and what are signs of its deficiency?", a: "Important for red blood cell formation, neurological function, and DNA synthesis. Deficiency causes megaloblastic anemia and neurological symptoms (paresthesia, gait disturbance, cognitive changes)." },
    { q: "What is the preferred route for enteral nutrition access for long-term feeding (>4-6 weeks) when gastric feeding is not tolerated?", a: "Jejunostomy tube (J-tube) or gastrojejunostomy tube (GJ-tube) placed endoscopically, surgically, or radiologically." },
    { q: "What is the primary role of the small intestine in digestion and absorption?", a: "The primary site for absorption of nutrients (carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals, water) into the bloodstream." },
    { q: "What is dumping syndrome and how is it managed with nutrition?", a: "A condition where food, especially high-sugar food, moves too quickly from the stomach to the small intestine, causing symptoms like nausea, cramping, diarrhea, and lightheadedness. Managed by small, frequent meals, avoiding high-sugar foods, separating liquids from solids, and increasing soluble fiber." },
    { q: "Which electrolyte is critical for cardiac function and can be severely impacted by refeeding syndrome?", a: "Potassium, Phosphate, and Magnesium." },
    { q: "How do opioids affect gut motility and potentially impact enteral nutrition delivery?", a: "Opioids decrease gut motility, leading to constipation, delayed gastric emptying, and potentially increasing the risk of aspiration with enteral feeds." },
    { q: "What is a common complication of PN involving the gallbladder?", a: "Gallbladder sludge and gallstone formation due to lack of enteral stimulation and bile stasis." },
    { q: "What is the energy content of 1 gram of dextrose in parenteral nutrition?", a: "3.4 kcal/gram." },

    { q: "What is a common strategy to prevent aspiration with enteral nutrition?", a: "Elevate the head of the bed to 30-45 degrees, check gastric residuals per protocol (though this practice is debated), use prokinetic agents if indicated, consider post-pyloric feeding." },
    { q: "What are the advantages of using a structured lipid emulsion (e.g., SMOFlipid, ClinOleic) over a standard soybean oil-based emulsion in PN?", a: "May reduce the risk of PN-associated liver disease, potentially improve immune function, and provide different fatty acid profiles (e.g., fish oil for anti-inflammatory effects)." },
    { q: "What is a normal serum albumin range, and why is it a poor indicator of acute malnutrition?", a: "Normal range is typically 3.5-5.0 g/dL. It's a poor indicator of acute malnutrition because it's a negative acute phase reactant, meaning its levels decrease during inflammation, infection, or trauma, independent of nutritional status." },
    { q: "What is microcytic anemia, and what common nutritional deficiency causes it?", a: "Anemia characterized by small red blood cells. Most commonly caused by iron deficiency." },
    { q: "What is macrocytic anemia, and what two common nutritional deficiencies cause it?", a: "Anemia characterized by large red blood cells. Most commonly caused by folate or vitamin B12 deficiency." },
